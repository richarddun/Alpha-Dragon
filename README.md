# Turn based battle game written in curses (Python)

This is an evolution of a simple text based 'one enemy at a time' survival battle game (simple_battle_game). Only difference is the curses implementation.
Currently it is a WIP.
Writes to terminal window at 189x50 (full screen terminal required at present)
Main entry point to program is logic.py

Plans to include : 
- Collectible loot
- Eventually implement unicurses, right now Windows is not supported
